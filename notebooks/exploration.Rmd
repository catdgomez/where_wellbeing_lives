Libraries I may use called
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
# install for visualizations 
library(ggplot2)
# install to combine date and time
library(lubridate)
# for melting a df
library(reshape)

```
Reading in the first dataset, perceived health status.
 
```{r}
perceived_health_status <- read_csv("../data/perceived_health_status.csv")
```
Inspecting the data.

```{r}
perceived_health_status %>% view()
```

Filtering.

```{r}
perceived_health_status %>% 
  filter(TIME_PERIOD == 2022) %>% 
  filter(REF_AREA == "AUT") %>% 
  filter(Sex == "Total") %>% 
  filter(Age == "15 years or over")  
```
Explore the time periods the data covers

```{r}

sort(unique(perceived_health_status$TIME_PERIOD))

```


```{r}

barplot(table(perceived_health_status$TIME_PERIOD), main = "number of observations of year in the data")

```
As it appears that after 2007, the number of observations are more significant in number, I will limit my data to 2007 and later. But, since it appears the number of observations drops off in 2024, I will limit my data to a range of 2007-2023.

```{r}

# input code to limit year range in perceived health status dataset here

```
